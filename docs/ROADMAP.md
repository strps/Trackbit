# Trackbit Roadmap

Last updated: December 19, 2025

## Vision
Trackbit aims to provide a modular, user-friendly habit and exercise tracking application with seamless integration for regulatory requirements (e.g., Costa Rican electronic invoicing via Hacienda v4.4).

## Milestones

### Q4 2025 - Foundation and Modularity (Current Focus)
- Complete monorepo refactor (Task 1: see [/docs/tasks/monorepo-refactor.md](./tasks/monorepo-refactor.md)).
- Implement reusable Hacienda client package (Task 2: see [/docs/tasks/hacienda-client-package.md](./tasks/hacienda-client-package.md)).
- Ensure compliance with Hacienda v4.4 (mandatory since September 1, 2025).

### Q1 2026 - Core Feature Enhancements
- Expand habit tracking: Structured sessions, negative habits, advanced analytics.
- Shared UI package stabilization and component expansions.

### Q2 2026 - Scalability and Integrations
- API optimizations and potential mobile app scaffolding.
- Full Hacienda document type support.
- User feedback-driven iterations (e.g., social features if demand arises).

### Long-Term (2026+)
- Open-source contributions or community packages.
- Advanced reporting and export features.

## Progress Tracking
- Active tasks: See [/docs/TODO.md](../TODO.md).
- Completed milestones archived in CHANGE_LOG.md.

## Risks
- Regulatory changes: Monitor Hacienda updates closely.
- Scope creep: Prioritize core habit tracking before expansions.
